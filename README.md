# FPPLS
The forward projection PLS provides an embedded and data-driven conditional method for variable selection. Here, we use the largest regression coefficients or VIP value as the active conditional variable in each iteration and then deflates the prediction matrix and response orthogonally. The whole steps can be seen in the paper of Li, Xu, Xiao, Li, Wang, and Xu (2020).
